# Installing Gulp

You need to have Node.js (Node) installed onto your computer before you can install Gulp.

If you do not have Node installed already, you can get it by downloading the package installer from Node's website.

When you're done with installing Node, you can install Gulp by using the following command in the command line:

-----
	$ sudo npm install gulp -g
